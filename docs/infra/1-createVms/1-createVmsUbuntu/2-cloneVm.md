# Clone a virtual machine in KVM

* To clone from an Existing virtual machine in KVM. Follow the below steps

## 1. Make A git Clone of KVM repository

* Install git on your local machine

```
[host@machine ~]$  sudo yum install git -y
```

* Goto kvm repository [link](https://github.com/123iris/kvm.git) 

```
[host@machine ~]$  cd ~
[host@machine ~]$  git clone https://github.com/123iris/kvm.git
```

## 2. Goto infra directory

```
[host@machine ~]$  cd ~/kvm/code/infra/1-createVms/createVmUbuntu/2-CloneVms
```

## 3. Check VM clone.sh file

```
[host@machine 2-CloneVms]$  ls
vmClone.sh
```

## 4. Run vmClone.sh file to create ubuntu20.1Base machine

```
[host@machine ~]$ bash vmClone.sh ubuntu20.1Base ubuntu20Base
 Are you sure you want to clone ubuntu20.1Base from ubuntu20Base? y

```

* list machine

```
[host@machine ~]$ virsh list --all

 Id   Name           State
-------------------------------
 -    centos78Base   shut off
 -    centos7Base    shut off
 -    nseCollectVm   shut off
 -    ubuntu20.1Base shut off
 -    ubuntu20Base   shut off
```

## 5. Get Mac address for centos78Base machine

* Now add Mac address of centos78Base to default network file

```
[host@machine ~]$ virsh dumpxml ubuntu20.1Base | grep "mac address"
	 <mac address='52:54:00:6c:b1:48'/>
```

## 6. Add MAC address, IP address to default network 

```
[host@machine ~]$ virsh net-edit default
# Will bring up the editor
# Add following lines in the dhcp section of the XML, like so:
<network>
  <name>default</name>
  <uuid>90aae6fb-c6c4-415f-af9a-4a4b4c9f7145</uuid>
  <forward mode='nat'/>
  <bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/>
  <mac address='52:54:00:4a:8b:c4'/>
  <ip address='192.168.122.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.122.2' end='192.168.122.254'/>
         <host mac='52:54:00:29:4b:e5' name='ubuntu20Base' ip='192.168.122.13'/>
         <host mac='52:54:00:6c:b1:48' name='ubuntu20.1Base' ip='192.168.122.14'/>   # like this
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>
```

* Add the IP address to /etc/hosts file

```
[host@machine ~]$ sudo vim /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.0.1       www.localhost
127.0.1.1       machine
192.168.122.13  ubuntu20Base
192.168.122.14  ubuntu20.1Base     # like this

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

```

* Restart the virtual network for assignements to take effect:

```
[host@machine ~]$ virsh net-destroy default
[host@machine ~]$ virsh net-start default
```
* Now verify whether you are able to access vms using IP address

```
[host@machine ~]$ virsh list --all

 Id   Name           	  State
-------------------------------
 -    ubuntu20.1Base   shut off
 -    ubuntu20Base     shut off
```
```
[host@machine ~]$ virsh start ubuntu20.1Base
Domain centos78Base started
```

```
[host@machine ~]$ virsh net-dhcp-leases default 

 Expiry Time           MAC address         Protocol   IP address         Hostname       Client ID or DUID

```

* As its a clone copy of centos7Base machine. we can have passwordless access 

```
[host@machine ~]$ ssh mosipuser@ubuntu20.1Base

## 7. Update centos from ubuntu20.04 to ubuntu20.10

This is followed from [Here](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu-to-20-10) 

* Check centos version 

```
[mosipuser@ubuntu20:~]$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
Release:	20.04
Codename:	focal
```

* Fully update and upgrade your current Ubuntu 20.04 Linux system.

```
[mosipuser@ubuntu20:~]$ sudo apt update  -y
[mosipuser@ubuntu20:~]$ sudo apt upgrade -y
[mosipuser@ubuntu20:~]$ sudo apt dist-upgrade
```
* Remove all no longer required packages:

```
[mosipuser@ubuntu20:~]$ sudo apt autoremove
```

* Configure the release upgrader. Open and edit the /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades file and ensure that the Prompt variable is set to normal.

```
[mosipuser@ubuntu20:~]$ vim /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades

# Default behavior for the release upgrader.

[DEFAULT]
# Default prompting behavior, valid options:
#
#  never  - Never check for a new release.
#  normal - Check to see if a new release is available.  If more than one new
#           release is found, the release upgrader will attempt to upgrade to
#           the release that immediately succeeds the currently-running
#           release.
#  lts    - Check to see if a new LTS release is available.  The upgrader
#           will attempt to upgrade to the first LTS release available after
#           the currently-running one.  Note that this option should not be
#           used if the currently-running release is not itself an LTS
#           release, since in that case the upgrader won't be able to
#           determine if a newer release is available.
Prompt=normal
```
Save the file

* Begin the Ubuntu 20.10 upgrade process by executing the following command:

```
[mosipuser@ubuntu20:~]$ sudo do-release-upgrade
```

* Package configuration (Select YES)
